Today is day 1
The above are two codes that represent the same thing,That is a calculator application using react JS
The first application Called  Online Calculator,while the second one is called Test Online calculator
Here is a breakdown of how I have developed the two applications and what I have learnt today
1.Input type="button"-Has been quite important ,providing a button used in the calculator
2.The use of a form
3.The use of some great code in css- That is things like
a.Font-weight
b.flex: 1;
c.Display: flex;
(and many more but this are some of the codes I have learnt today

The Test online calculator is more improved than the Online calculator since I have added some features on the Test online calculator which were not included on the online calculator
i.e
1. have added a modulus operator
2.I have added Greater than and smaller than and less than operators
e.t.c
On the Javascript aspect,Today I worked on 
Onclick and used useState (Which is basically imported from React(useState} from react
Future Improvements 
1.I might work on improving on the calculator such as adding new operators such as   Square root operator and sin and cos e.t.c
2.Also I will also try to learn more on Javascript ,and css,I am greate with css
